Industry leader in prototyping &amp; on-demand manufacturing visioned a platform enabling them to add new manufacturing services and offerings at a rapidly growing pace. My work on the experience platform involved developing a npm based design system for ultimate component reusability, dockerizing all of their dotnet core and node based API applications. I also lead the internationalization translation and localization efforts. As front end architect I enabled rapid continuous deployment of individual teams for near immediate feedback and agility.</p>
