# How I got here 2019
I have spent 20 years as a user interface developer, enabling companies as large as SAP to companies of only 1 or 2 principles to unblock their potential. Utilizing tools such as JavaScript, cloud development, devops, Java, Docker & .NET core.

## Timeline
2017-Current
##Protolabs*
Industry leader in prototyping & on-demand manufacturing visioned a platform enabling them to add new manufacturing services and offerings at a rapidly growing pace. My work on the experience platform involved developing a npm based design system for ultimate component reusability, dockerizing all of their dotnet core and node based API applications. I also lead the internationalization translation and localization efforts. As front end architect I enabled rapid continuous deployment of individual teams for near immediate feedback and agility.
